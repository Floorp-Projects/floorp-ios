# 8. Floorp Directory Consolidation Architecture

Date: 2026-04-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As described in [ADR-0007](0007-upstream-merge-rebrand-strategy.md), Floorp for iOS is forked from Firefox for iOS. Initially, Floorp customizations were applied by directly editing Firefox source files (e.g., inserting early returns into telemetry methods, modifying initialization code). While functional, this approach has several problems:

1. **Merge conflict surface area** — Each direct edit to a Firefox file creates a conflict point during upstream merges. When Mozilla changes the same file, the merge may fail or produce incorrect results.

2. **Scattered changes** — Floorp modifications were spread across 4+ Firefox files with no clear organizational structure. Developers must search the entire codebase to understand what Floorp has changed.

3. **No clear ownership boundary** — Without a physical separation between Firefox code and Floorp code, it is difficult to distinguish upstream code from project-specific customizations.

4. **Fragile sed patterns** — The rebrand script relied on complex multi-line sed patterns to inject code into Firefox files. These patterns are brittle and break when upstream reformats code.

The Firefox iOS codebase provides several extensibility mechanisms that make direct editing unnecessary:

- **DI container** (`AppContainer` using Dip) — Services registered at bootstrap time
- **Static flag checks** — Boolean flags checked at method entry points
- **Coordinator pattern** — Route-based navigation with protocol conformance
- **WKUserScript** — Web content modification via script injection
- **Modular architecture** — BrowserKit SPM package with 20+ framework libraries

## Decision

We adopt a **consolidated Floorp directory** architecture with flag-based hooks.

### Directory Structure

All Floorp-specific code resides in a single `Floorp/` directory at the project root:

```
Floorp/
├── FloorpFlags.swift         # Feature flags checked at hook points
└── FloorpBootstrapper.swift  # Single entry point called at startup
```

### Hook Mechanism

Instead of directly modifying Firefox method bodies, we use a two-part system:

1. **FloorpBootstrapper** — Called from `DependencyHelper.bootstrapDependencies()` with a single line:
   ```swift
   FloorpBootstrapper.configure()
   ```
   This sets all Floorp feature flags before any Firefox code runs.

2. **FloorpFlags** — Static boolean flags checked at Firefox hook points:
   ```swift
   if FloorpFlags.isTelemetryDisabled { return }
   ```

### Firefox Files Modified (Hook Points Only)

Only 4 Firefox files need minimal modifications (~2 lines each):

| File | Hook | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `DependencyHelper.swift` | `FloorpBootstrapper.configure()` | Entry point |
| `TelemetryWrapper.swift` | `FloorpFlags.isTelemetryDisabled` (×2) | Glean telemetry |
| `MetricKitWrapper.swift` | `FloorpFlags.isTelemetryDisabled` | Apple MetricKit |
| `SentryWrapper.swift` | Direct `return` | Sentry (BrowserKit boundary) |

### BrowserKit Constraint

`SentryWrapper` resides in `BrowserKit/Sources/Common/`, which is a separate SPM package. It cannot import the `Floorp` module directly. For this case, we keep a direct `return` statement (acceptable since the DSN key is also absent from Info.plist, providing double protection).

### Rebrand Script Integration

`scripts/rebrand-to-floorp.sh` Step 7 is updated to:
1. Ensure `Floorp/` directory and files exist (idempotent creation)
2. Inject hook comments into the 4 Firefox files (only if not already present)
3. Use grep-based idempotency checks to prevent duplicate injection

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Minimal merge conflicts** — Only 4 Firefox files modified, each with ~2 lines of changes. Upstream changes to these files are unlikely to conflict with our hooks.
- **Clear ownership** — All Floorp code is in one directory. Easy to audit, review, and maintain.
- **Easy onboarding** — New developers can find all Floorp customizations in `Floorp/` without searching the codebase.
- **Extensible** — Adding new customizations only requires adding flags to `FloorpFlags` and methods to `FloorpBootstrapper`.
- **Idempotent** — Rebrand script can be run multiple times safely.

### Negative

- **Flag overhead** — Each hook point requires a corresponding flag in `FloorpFlags`. For large numbers of customizations, the flags file may grow.
- **Runtime cost** — Flag checks add a negligible branch at each hook point (a static boolean comparison).
- **BrowserKit exception** — `SentryWrapper` cannot use the flag pattern and must use a direct return, which is slightly less clean.
- **Build dependency** — The `Floorp/` directory must be included in the Xcode project target for the code to compile.

### Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Upstream renames/removes a hooked method | Rebrand script grep checks will fail gracefully with warnings |
| Floorp/ directory accidentally excluded from build | Document in rebrand script; verify in CI |
| Flag name collision with upstream code | Use `Floorp` prefix consistently |
